# Introducing the LLM Open Connector

The LLM Open Connector is an [API specification](/docs/apis/llm-open-connector/), closely based on the OpenAI API, that lets you create API gateways and proxy servers that connect any language model to the Einstein AI Platform. Any service that implements the API specification can be connected to Einstein Studio using the Bring Your Own LLM (BYOLLM) feature.

The LLM Open Connector opens up a world of possibilities for bespoke AI applications for Salesforce customers and independent software vendors (ISVs). Check out our recipes to learn how to bring new models to Einstein Studio!
