# LLM Open Connector + Grok

Learn how to implement Salesforce's [LLM Open Connector](/docs/apis/llm-open-connector/) with the xAI platform and [Grok](https://x.ai/news/grok-4). This blog walks through generating an xAI API key and creating a configured model in Salesforce. No custom scripts or deployments are required.

## Prerequisites

1. If you don't already have one, [create an xAI account](https://accounts.x.ai/sign-up).
2. Create a team in the [xAI Cloud Console](https://console.x.ai/).

3. Purchase some xAI API credits.
4. Create an API key.

## Integrate with Agentforce

xAI is fully compatible with the Open Connector API specification, so you can follow the LLM Open Connector [product guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/10/build-generative-ai-solutions-with-llm-open-connector). Follow the steps in this post for an overview.

### Step 1. Add a Foundation Model

- Add `https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions` to the **URL** field.
- Add your API secret to the **Auth Key** field.
- Add `grok-4` to the **Model Name** field.

### Step 4. Create A Configured Model

Before you can use your connected model, you need to create a configured model. Select grok-4 in the Model Library and click **New Configuration**.

Test your model in the the Model Playground. When you're ready, you can save your configuration and create the model for use in Salesforce.

### Step 5. Start Using Grok

You can now use [Grok 4](https://x.ai/news/grok-4) via Salesforce's Open Connector! You can leverage Grokâ€™s advanced reasoning in your Agentforce application to handle complex requests and streamline workflows.

To monitor consumption, purchase additional credits, and manage your Grok models, use the [xAI Cloud console](https://console.x.ai/).
